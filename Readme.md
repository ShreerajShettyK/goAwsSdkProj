| Component                    | Description                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWS SDK for Go               | The official AWS SDK for the Go programming language, used for interacting with AWS services programmatically.           |
| Jenkins CLI                  | Command-line interface for Jenkins, used to perform administrative tasks and automation.                                 |
| Groovy Scripting Language    | Used to write scripts for Jenkins automation, such as unlocking Jenkins and configuring security settings.               |
| AWS EC2                     | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is used to provision virtual servers (instances) on AWS.                               |
| Jenkins                     | Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to reliably build, test, and deploy software.         |
| Go MongoDB Driver           | The official MongoDB driver for Go, used to connect to and interact with MongoDB databases.                               |

## Web Service

The Go web service in this repository is designed to run on an AWS EC2 instance and interact with a MongoDB database. It provides an HTTP endpoint that fetches data from the MongoDB collection "Table1".

## Setup Instructions

1. **Configure AWS SDK Credentials**: Ensure that your AWS SDK is configured with the necessary credentials to interact with AWS services.

2. **EC2 Instance Setup**: Set up an EC2 instance on AWS, ensuring it meets the prerequisites for running Jenkins and the Go web service.

3. **Security Group Configuration**: Create a security group allowing inbound traffic on port 8000 for the Go web service.

4. **Jenkins Installation**: Install Jenkins on the EC2 instance using the provided automation utilities.

5. **MongoDB Setup**: Set up a MongoDB database either locally or on a cloud provider such as MongoDB Atlas.

6. **Deploy Web Service**: Deploy the Go web service to the EC2 instance, ensuring it can connect to the MongoDB database.

7. **Automation**: Use the provided utilities to automate Jenkins setup and management tasks.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine or directly onto the EC2 instance.

2. **Execute the Utilities**: Use the provided Go utilities to automate Jenkins setup and management tasks.

3. **Deploy Web Service**: Build and deploy the Go web service to the EC2 instance.

4. **Customization**: Modify the utilities, Groovy scripts, or Go web service as needed to suit your specific requirements.

5. **Monitor Logs**: Monitor the logs generated by the utilities and the web service to ensure successful execution and troubleshoot any issues.
